 * Output-parameters are only applied if the current code-block exits its
   branch at the 'proper' point.

 * Specifying .init_vf with a register-range will result in a argument-error.
   This will be solved when the tokenizer has been extended to handle the
   'range' modifier.

 * The register-allocator is line-based right now, which means that for example
   a 'move test,test' will allocate a different register for the destination if
   no more dependency connects them (for example a loop will work around this
   problem). Some kind of 'sub-line' (argument offset?) included into the range
   could do the trick.

 * GASP preparsing code does not track the current filename.

 * The CLIP operands are now present but not properly validated.

 * The expression evaluator should output a hexadecimal value instead of a float.
